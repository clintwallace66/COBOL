# COBOL
I have attached some of the projects that I have completed using COBOL. I really enjoy COBOL and the challenges it brings. I still have a lot to learn and I am by no means an expert but I still love COBOL as a whole.
EACH PROGRAM HAS ITS OWN BRANCH
I WILL UPLOAD A FINAL BRANCH WITH ALL MY LABS DONE INBETWEEN EACH PROGRAM
